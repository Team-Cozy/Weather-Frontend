# Weather Clothing Suggestion App

Have you ever been poorly dressed for the weather? Never again, with the Cozy App! This app takes in either the user’s location data or a city entered by the user to retrieve the corresponding weather data. Based on this weather data and the user’s customizable temperature/outfit preferences, this app makes suggestions to the user regarding what outfit they should wear for the current weather!
